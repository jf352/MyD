# MyD
Linux full-system backup utility

At the moment this is just a small script but will be expanded over time as the mood strikes...

#INSTALLATION:

Just copy the files anywhere into your $PATH.

#USAGE:

To backup, call:

bmd /path/to/backup/location/

To restore, call:

rmd /path/to/backup/location/

You will be prompted with a confirmation (or a failure if the location doesn't already exist). Type "YES" to confirm.
